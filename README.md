# SudokuSolver
This is a Sudoku Solver that uses the backtracking algorithm. Using pygame, I created a Sudoku grid where I manually put in a puzzle. Feel free to try and solve it. Iâ€™m working on making the algorithm more efficient, as well as generating another random Sudoku grid when the user completes the puzzle. Those updates are coming soon. So make sure to stay tuned for more Sudoku puzzles everyday!
