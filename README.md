# SudokuSolver
This is a Soduko Solver that uses the backtracking algorithm. 
Using pygame I created a Soduka grid where I manually put in a puzzle. Feel free to try and solve it. As of now the algorithm I used for this project is not that efficient but I am working on making it faster. As well as working on generating a random Soduka grid when the user completes a puzzle. Those updates are coming soon. So make sure to stay tuned for more Soduka puzzles everyday!
